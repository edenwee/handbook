## Logo usage

The clear space surrounding the Volkis logo is an important part of ensuring quality representation and consistency of brand. The recommended clear space is visible in these examples. Space allows the logo to stand out and not be crowded by other typography or graphics. The minimum logo size also works to maintain consistency and clarity of the brand in reproduction. Please use great care to ensure this clarity is maintained when using the brand elements over photography or coloured backgrounds.

The preferred clear space is equal to the height of the ‘O’, as indicated. This translates to the clear space that exists within the dotted border as shown here. This area is not to be encroached  by any other typography or graphics.
