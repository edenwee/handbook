title: Third-party service providers
---

We use a lot of 3rd party service providers. Following the Volkis mantra of "do what you love", we don't want to reinvent the wheel for everything we do. Hence, we rely on others to do what they love, so that we can focus on what we love. Here is a list of our 3rd party providers and their purpose:
